/*
** HOW TO USE YOUR KEYBOARD WITH MEDNAFEN
**
** 1) Edit \Emulators\mednafen\mednafen.cfg and search "ss.input.port1" and set the value to "keyboard" instead of "gamepad"
** 2) When the emulator is running press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Menu] to toggle keyboard emulation in Mednafen.
**    Note: If it works, a message "Input Grabbing: On" appears.
** 3) When your game runs press [Esc]+[Down] with your keyboard or [Start]+[Down] with your gamepad to display the console.
**
** Full documentation here: https://mednafen.github.io/documentation/ss.html
**
** ▲ Debug console is in work in progress ▲
** Soon you will be able to load / replace sprite at runtime and many other things with native commands.
**
** Available builtins commands:
**
** bkg <colorname>
** - colorname: (Optional) white|black|red|green|yellow|blue|purple|cyan|gray|transparent
**              Default: transparent
**
** load sprite <filename> [transparent_color_name] [subdir]
** - filename: Case sensitive filename
** - transparent_color_name: (Optional) white|black|red|green|yellow|blue|purple|cyan|gray|transparent
**              Default: transparent
** - subdir: (Optional) Case sensitive subdir name
**              Default: Current directory
**
** load map <layer> <zindex> <filename> [subdir]
** - layer: Layer value beetween 0 and JO_MAP_MAX_LAYER
** - zindex: Z-Index (signed short)
** - filename: Case sensitive filename
** - subdir: (Optional) Case sensitive subdir name
**              Default: Current directory
**
** exit
