# Programming for Beginners on Saturn
 
This tutorial series is based upon the Jo-Engine SDK by Johannes Fetz:<br>
https://jo-engine.org/

Despite the Sega Saturn being one of the most difficult consoles to program for,<br>
due to its complex architecture and many many different specialized chips,<br>
Johannes has designed a very useful SDK, which is very beginner friendly and easy to set up.

With this SDK it is possible to hit the ground running, especially if you have previous<br>
coding experience. Which I do not have... :(

But since I am incredibly stubborn and have pestered the poor unsuspecting members of SegaXtreme<br>
for the past years, I have least aquired a basic knowledge of the Sega Saturn and how to program<br>
for it. Currently (literally as I type this) for example, I am learning to use markdown. Hooray!

Some advice:

- I will frequently add notes for further reading. Read it and do the tutorials or the Saturn will eat you alive.
- The Saturn hates you, your children and your extended family. You will require years to learn how to program it<br>
and all the patience you can possibly muster. You will need to be incredibly stubborn to do homebrew for it<br>
(or foolish or both).
- You are not going to make the 3D Sonic we never got. Your project ideas are most certainly way to big<br>
and the Saturn wants to devour your immortal soul for even attempting to make your dream a reality.<br>
Fail faster (or suffer like I do/did).
