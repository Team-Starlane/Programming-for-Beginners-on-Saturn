# Programming for Beginners on Saturn
 
This tutorial series is based upon the Jo-Engine SDK by Johannes Fetz:<br>
https://jo-engine.org/

Despite the Sega Saturn being one of the most difficult consoles to program for,<br>
due to its complex architecture and many many different specialized chips,<br>
Johannes has designed a very useful SDK, which is very beginner friendly and easy to set up.

With this SDK it is possible to hit the ground running, especially if you have previous<br>
coding experience.
